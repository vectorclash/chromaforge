# ChromaForge — project context for Claude

This file is the portable handoff doc for this project. It's checked into git specifically
so that any Claude Code session — on any machine — has the architecture decisions and
current state without needing the original chat history. Keep it updated as work lands;
treat the bullet points below as living facts, not a changelog (prune/update rather than
appending forever).

## What this is

A generative art web app (live at **chromaforge.app**). Vite + React, static build,
deployed via GitHub Actions → FTP on every push to `master` (see
`.github/workflows/deploy.yml`). UI language is "the artwork is the interface": the
generated piece fills the screen; controls live in a small frosted-glass panel that
floats on top. Designs are JSON, re-renderable via Canvas2D from that JSON alone.

**The goal in progress:** turn a saved design into printed merch (shirts/hoodies) via
Printful, with user accounts and a gallery. Stack: Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Storage),
Stripe (payment), Printful (fulfillment), Vite/React frontend (unchanged).

## Architecture decisions (the load-bearing ones)

### Renderer: seed-based, not pixel-based
The renderer is a pure deterministic function of `(seed, colors, settings, width,
height)` — NOT stored pixel/normalized coordinates. A tiny JSON `{ generatorVersion,
seed, colors, settings }` reconstructs the full artwork at any size/ratio. This was a
deliberate choice over "store the resolved composition": it enables **method-4
recompose-per-ratio** — screen and print are sibling compositions generated fresh from
the same seed, not the same layout reflowed. The print mockup the customer approves is
the actual print, generated the same deterministic way.

- `src/render/prng.js` — seeded PRNG (xmur3 + mulberry32: `makeRng`, `randomSeed`,
  `randomColorHex`). Every `Generate*` class in `src/components/Canvas/` takes an `rng`
  param and uses it instead of `Math.random()`/`tinycolor.random()`.
- `src/render/generateArtwork.js` / `src/render/renderArtwork.js` — pure, React-free
  generation/compositing, so the same code can eventually run server-side (Node/headless)
  for print resolution. `GENERATOR_VERSION` bumps when the algorithm changes in a way that
  alters output for a given seed.
- **Print rendering must be server-side**, not client-side: iOS Safari caps canvas area
  around 16.7 Mpx, and 150 DPI print (4200×5400 = 22.7 Mpx) exceeds that. Desktop Chrome
  handles it fine (proven up to 300 DPI), but mobile can't — this is why a render service
  is still needed before the print pipeline is real.
- **Still open:** make the generators genuinely *ratio-aware* (sizes off `min(w,h)`,
  counts off area) rather than just stretching — tune this on real test renders, it's a
  visual judgment call, not pure math. Old pre-seed saved designs (absolute-pixel, no
  seed) can only be reflowed, not recomposed — treat as best-effort, not a blocker.

### MP4 export: client-side (WebCodecs), not server-side
Animation export is fully client-side: WebCodecs (`VideoEncoder`/`VideoFrame`,
`AudioEncoder`/`AudioData`) muxed with `mp4-muxer`. All in
`src/components/DisplayCanvas.jsx` (`exportAnimationVideo`, `encodeAudioTrack`). **There
is no `server/` directory, no `/api/export`, no Vite proxy** — an earlier server-side
FFmpeg design was fully removed; don't reintroduce it from old assumptions. Prefers H.264
Constrained Baseline (`avc1.42E034`) specifically to avoid B-frame reordering, which
silently halved framerate on Windows hardware encoders. This is a *different* concern
from print rendering above (video vs. still images) — don't conflate the two.

### Backend: Supabase, seed-first schema
- `supabase/migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql` — `profiles` (1:1 auth.users, trigger
  auto-created on signup), `designs` (`data` jsonb = `{ generatorVersion, seed, colors,
  ... }`, public-readable by default, write-owner-only via RLS), `likes` (junction,
  triggers keep `likes_count` in sync).
- `src/lib/supabase.js` / `designs.js` / `auth.js` — client + data access + email/password
  auth. The client is guarded: exports `null` and warns if env vars are missing, so the
  app doesn't crash without Supabase configured.
- **Gotcha:** the public-gallery query disambiguates the `profiles` embed with
  `profiles!designs_user_id_fkey(...)` — the `likes` junction creates a second
  designs↔profiles join path that confuses PostgREST otherwise.
- **Email/password plus Google OAuth.** Google sign-in needed a Google Cloud Console
  OAuth client (Web application type, authorized redirect URI =
  `https://fgrhbzqzadpjpbzuszpm.supabase.co/auth/v1/callback`) and the resulting Client
  ID/Secret entered in the Supabase dashboard's Authentication → Providers → Google
  config — that's all dashboard-side, no migration. `signInWithGoogle()` in `auth.js`
  reuses the same redirect-handling code already built for email confirmation links.
- Backend is live and verified against the real Supabase project (connection, RLS, the
  embed query, auth endpoint all checked). **Now wired into the UI**, all in
  `DisplayCanvas.jsx`: a Sign In/Account panel (email/password + "Continue with Google",
  with a banner handling Supabase's auth redirect — it lands back on the app with a
  token in the URL hash, which needs explicit UI feedback since `supabase-js` consumes
  it silently),
  Save now also persists to the `designs` table for signed-in users (alongside the
  existing share-link, which still works for everyone), and a Gallery panel
  (Public / My Designs tabs) that lists saved designs and reloads one onto the canvas on
  click.
- **Gallery now has thumbnails, delete, and pagination.** Saving a design regenerates it
  from its own seed/colors at 320x320 (recompose-per-ratio, same approach as the main
  renderer — not a downscaled screenshot of the full canvas) and uploads it to the
  `design-thumbnails` Supabase Storage bucket (`supabase/migrations/
  0002_design_thumbnails_storage.sql`), keyed by `${user_id}/${design_id}.jpg` so RLS can
  check ownership from the path alone — no DB column tracks "has a thumbnail"; a missing
  object just 404s client-side (`<img onError>` hides it), which is what happens for
  designs saved before this existed. My Designs has a per-row Delete (wired to the
  existing `deleteDesign`); the Public tab pages 20 at a time via `listPublicDesigns`'s
  `before` cursor with a "Load More" button.
- **Gotcha:** Supabase's confirmation email links hit Supabase's own verify endpoint
  first (not the app directly), which consumes the one-time token and *then* redirects to
  the app's redirect URL with the session in the hash. If that redirect URL is unreachable
  (e.g. dev server not running yet), the token is still consumed — a retry click will
  show "invalid or expired" even though the account was already confirmed. Fixed by
  passing `emailRedirectTo: window.location.origin` in `signUpWithEmail` (`auth.js`) so
  the link targets whichever environment the user actually signed up from; both
  `localhost:5173` and `chromaforge.app` need to be in Supabase Auth → URL Configuration's
  redirect allow-list for this to work (already added).

### Styling: Tailwind v4, fully migrated (not partial)
The whole app was migrated from SCSS to Tailwind v4 + a small custom-CSS layer — this was
the user's explicit call, made *against* an earlier instinct to leave the working UI
alone, because "do it now while the app is small." It's done and merged to `master`.

- `src/tailwind.css` — `@import 'tailwindcss'` (Preflight is **enabled**), the
  `--font-quicksand` token, the relocated Quicksand/Exo Google Fonts `@import url()`
  (must stay the first statement in the file), and the few app-globals Preflight doesn't
  cover (bg color, full-viewport sizing, the font stack/smoothing).
- `src/styles/components.css` — scoped custom CSS for everything utilities can't express:
  glassmorphism `backdrop-filter`, gradient borders/fills, `@keyframes`, GSAP-morphed SVG
  internals, complex hover states, and the themed `jscolor` color-picker popup (see
  below). Everything here is scoped under `.display-canvas` or the relevant hook class.
- **Every GSAP/JS selector hook (class or id) was preserved** through the conversion —
  utilities were added alongside hook classes, never replacing them. If you touch
  `DisplayCanvas.jsx` or `ColorField.jsx`, grep for `gsap.` selectors and
  `querySelector`/`getAttribute('data-color-id')` before renaming any class.
- `src/components/Logo.jsx` + `Logo.scss` are the **one intentionally unconverted**
  leftover — it's the vectorclash logo mark, currently unused, earmarked for a future
  About page. Don't migrate it speculatively before it's actually mounted somewhere (you
  can't verify a conversion against a render that doesn't exist).
- The `jscolor` third-party color-picker popup (opened by tapping a color swatch) is
  themed via `jscolor.presets.default` in `index.html` (background/border/radius/shadow —
  most of it) plus targeted `!important` overrides in `components.css` for the bits the
  library sets via inline style (close-button font/hover) or doesn't expose as a preset
  option at all (inner palette/slider corner rounding, via structural `:has(> canvas)`
  selectors since those elements are unclassed). If you resize the picker
  (`width`/`height`/`sliderSize`/`padding` in the preset), the slider-rounding selector
  (`[style*='width: 20px']`) and the close-button's `right` value are both keyed to the
  current preset numbers — keep them in sync.

## Current state / what's deployed

`master` is deployed (push triggers GitHub Actions → FTP → chromaforge.app). As of the
last push, live includes: the seed-based renderer (Phases 1–2 of the print pipeline), the
full Tailwind migration, a batch of ColorField drag-and-drop fixes (dead-zone hit-testing,
swap-instead-of-insert reorder logic, a perf throttle, a listener-leak fix) plus the
jscolor picker theming, and the Supabase auth/save/gallery UI described above (built and
verified live, not yet pushed to `master` as of this writing — confirm it's been committed
before assuming it's deployed).

**Not yet started:** Printful/Stripe integration, server-side print rendering,
ratio-aware generation tuning.

## Local setup (new machine / clone)

1. `npm install`
2. Create `.env.local` (gitignored, not in git) with:
   ```
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL=<see Supabase dashboard>
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=<the "publishable" key, sb_publishable_... works fine with supabase-js v2>
   ```
   Ask the developer for these — they're real project credentials, not regenerable from
   the repo.
3. `npm start` → Vite dev server on **port 5173** (not 3000 — `.claude/launch.json` is
   already corrected for this, but if it drifts again, 5173 is Vite's actual default).
4. Build/verify with `npm run build` before considering any change done.

## Working conventions established this project

- **Verify every styling/behavior change against a live baseline** — computed-style
  diffs, screenshots, and actual interaction tests (drag, click, toggle), not just "it
  builds." This caught several real bugs (clipped pointer indicators, dead-zone hit
  testing, a reorder-logic bug) that a build-only check would have missed.
- Prefer fixing root causes over hardcoded magic numbers — e.g. the close-button width
  fix uses `left`/`right` anchoring so it self-adjusts if the picker is resized, instead
  of a fixed pixel width that would drift out of sync.
- Don't migrate/touch code that isn't actually exercised yet (see Logo.jsx above) — you
  can't verify a change against a render that doesn't exist.
